## Project Tasks

### Add sentry logging

Issue: https://github.com/Blonteractor/discord-amibot/issues/12
Level: medium

### Performance metrics

Issue: https://github.com/Blonteractor/discord-amibot/issues/11
Level: Hard
Description: The bot is kinda slow right now so finding out why would be nice.

### [shuttle] Envoirement syncronisation between worskpaces

Issue: https://github.com/Blonteractor/discord-amibot/issues/9
Level: Hard
Description:
As shuttle doesn’t use a normal .env file but a special Secrets.toml which can only be accessed by the bot workspace. But the amizone workspace also needs to access some secrets.
After much thought I decided the best way would be to create another worspace that acts as a secrets manager(?). Then the other workspaces can ask it for secrets
