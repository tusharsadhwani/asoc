# Interpreted: A Python interpreter, written in Python

This is an interpreter created as a teaching exercise, explaining how the Python language works internally.

While it works as it is now, it is missing a lot of Python features, and is pretty far from being “feature complete”. Adding these features is an extremely hands-on way to learn how Python, and programming languages in general, are built and designed.

# Project tasks

## Level: Easy

### **`UnboundLocalError` not implemented**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/1

The interpreter currently doesn't check if a variable is being read before being assigned to in a scope.

It leads to bugs like this:

```python
x = 10

def f():
    x = x + 1  # reading the variable from global, but writing in local
    print(x)

f()
print(x)
```

```bash
$ interpreted asd.py
11
10
```

This should throw `UnboundLocalError` instead.

### **Language feature: `bytes` type**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/14

Currently, strings are supported but bytes are not. Adding a bytes type would mean:

- Tokenizing strings with a `b` prefix
- Implementing operators (`+`, `*` and `[]`) for bytes.

```python
a = b'abc'
print(a)         # b'abc'
print(a[0])      # 97
print(a * 2)     # b'abcabc'
print(a + b'd')  # b'abcd'
```

### Supporting unicode escapes

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/8

Currently, using unicode escapes like `\u1234` and `\U12345678` don't work. They should print `ሴ` and `🙃` respectively.

```python
print('Hello \U0001F643, this is a unicode character: \u1234')
# Hello 🙃, this is a unicode character: ሴ
```

### **Detecting syntax errors due to `return` outside a function**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/11

This will require ✨Semantic Analysis✨

Essentially, the parsed AST will have to be visited by a semantic analyzer, before it is passed to the interpreter.

This semantic analyzer should do 2 things:

- Detect any presence of `return` statements outside of a function
- Detect any presence of `break` or `continue` outside of a loop

In both cases, we should raise a `SyntaxError`.

### **Language feature: `global` keyword**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/12

Using the `global` keyword helps define the scope of a specific variable inside a function.

For example:

```python
x = 0

def foo():
    x = 1

foo()
print(x)  # still 0
```

But, using `global`:

```python
x = 0

def foo():
    global x  # now, we know to always get/set x from global scope.
    x = 1

foo()
print(x)  # 1
```

### **Comments at the end of file don't work**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/5

Currently, if a file ends in a comment, the tokenizer crashes.

```python
print("Hi!)
# this doesn't work
```

## Level: Medium

### **Language feature: Decorators**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/2

Implementing decorators would be pretty simple.

Adding syntax sugar for:

```python
@foo
def function():
   ...
```

To mean:

```python
def function():
    ...

function = foo(function)
```

There are some caveats (the variable `function` is not supposed to be defined when the decorator `foo` is running), but essentially that is the feature.

### **Language feature: list, set, dict comprehensions**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/6

Current implementation supports lists, sets and dicts, but it doesn't support their comprehensions.

Code like:

```python
my_list = [i*2 for i in range(10)]
my_set = {i*j for i in range(10) for j in range(10)}
my_dict = {i: i*2 for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0}
```

### **Language feature: closures**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/3

Python supports closures.

Closures are a langauge feature where Python is able to access variables from scopes that are outside the local scope.

For example:

```python
def pattern():
    i = 0

    def print_stars():
        print('*' * i)

    while i <= 5:
        print_stars()
        i += 1

pattern()
```

This outputs the following:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

`print_stars()` is able to access `i` from from the local variables defined inside `pattern()`.

This currently doesn't work.

### **Better stack traces**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/4

Currently, a crash leads to a stack trace that contains the interpreter code.

Instead of that, emulating a Python stack, and printing a traceback of that would be quite good.

### **Language feature: file I/O with `open()`**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/10

The current interpreter can't interact with the file system, but implementing `open` will solve that.

Support for reading, writing and appending to files will be needed.

```python
file = open('foo.txt')
contents = file.read()
print(contents)
file.close()

file = open('bar.txt', 'w')
chars = file.write(contents)
print("Wrote", chars, "chars")
file.close()
```

### **Language feature: imports**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/13

Imports essentially just run a Python file, while keeping all their variables in a fresh scope.

```python
import foo  # should create a `foo` object containing all items in `foo.py`
from foo import bar  # should just import the `bar` object from `foo.py`
```

When an `import` statement is seen, it should:

- Change the `self.globals` dictionary of the interpreter to a new one
- Run that file's code
- Store this `self.globals` in an object, and assign that to the imported name.
- In case of a `from` import, just that variable should be assigned to the variable

---

There is a change that may be required for this to be
fully functional, that is every function may have to hold a reference to
its own global scopre, under `__globals__`. This should be used to look up variable names, instead of the `self.globals` which only holds the main module's global state.

But this change is not critical to the feature and can be added separately.

## Level: Hard

### **Language feature: Classes**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/7

The interpreter currently doesn't support classes.

Classes have a lot of nuance to them, but this specific issue will focus on three main things:

- Object creation, and handling their closures
- Method calls, and bound methods
- Various dunder methods like `__init__`, `__add__` and `__call__`.

Just this much will help support a much larger subset of Python.

Naturally, this issue will depend on the addition of closures, via [#3](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/3).

### **Language feature: generators and `yield` keyword**

Issue: https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/interpreted/issues/9

Generator functions are functions that contain the `yield` keyword.

Generator functions, instead of returning a value, return a `generator` object, which when called with the top level `next()` function, resumes the function and keeps running it until it `yield`s a value, and then pauses its execution.

For example:

```python
def generator():
    print("This runs first")
    yield 1
    print("This runs in between")
    yield 2
    print("This runs last")

gen = generator()
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen, 3))
```

Produces this output:

```
This runs first
1
This runs in between
2
This runs last
3
```
