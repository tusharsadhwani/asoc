# ** DevOps Track ** 

This is a unique track where mentees where will be working on CI/CD and deployment solutions for the projects in the other tracks. They will collaborate with mentors of other projects, gather requirements, and work towards a solution for each project.

Look out for CD/CD tags in the issue sections of other projects to find out which projects are looking for DevOps support.
