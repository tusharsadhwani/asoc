# About ASoC

Welcome to ASoC (ALiAS Summer of Code), an exciting open-source summer program organized by ALiAS (Amity Linux Assistance Sapience).
Our program is all about providing Amity students with a fantastic opportunity to dive into the world of open-source projects, gain valuable experience, and sharpen their skills in open-source software development. We believe in the power of collaboration, learning, and fostering a strong community of open-source contributors.

## Overview

ASoC is your chance to embark on a thrilling journey of open-source development, starting right here with contributions to ALiAS's very own homegrown projects. We're here to guide you, whether you're a complete beginner or already have a taste of open-source. Our program is designed to prepare you for other renowned open-source summer programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship, Linux Foundation Summer of Code (LFSoC), Outreachy, and GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC).

During ASoC, you'll get to work with large codebases, interact with experienced mentors, and gain hands-on experience in the open-source community. It's a supportive environment where beginners can overcome the initial challenges of open-source contribution and develop the skills and confidence needed to thrive in this exciting ecosystem.

## Our Mission and Goals

Our mission is clear: we want to empower you with incredible open-source contribution opportunities and strengthen the ALiAS community by fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation. We're here to spread awareness about open-source development and create a friendly, inclusive environment where contributors like you can shine.

Our program goals are simple but powerful:

- Provide a platform for you to gain practical experience in open-source development, regardless of your background or experience level.
- Encourage active participation and collaboration, because we believe the best projects are born from teamwork.
- Equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to make meaningful contributions to open-source projects, both during ASoC and beyond.
- Prepare you for future open-source programs and initiatives, setting you on a path of continuous growth and success.
- Build a supportive community of open-source contributors where you can learn, share, and thrive together.
