# Guidelines

Welcome to the Guidelines page of the ALiAS Summer of Code (ASoC) program. We are excited to have you on board! Here, we provide important information and expectations for participants, mentors, and mentees to ensure a smooth and productive experience throughout the program. Please take a moment to go through the following guidelines, as they will help you make the most out of your ASoC journey.

## Project Selection

The projects selected for ASoC are carefully chosen to offer mentees valuable learning experiences and the opportunity to make significant contributions. We have a diverse range of projects, including ALiAS's homegrown projects and other notable open-source projects. You have the flexibility to [browse](projects/browse-projects) and select from the predefined projects or [propose](/projects/submit-project-proposal) your own project for consideration.

To make the most informed decision, we encourage you to explore the project descriptions, technologies involved, and expected outcomes. Choose a project that aligns with your interests, skills, and the program's objectives. This will ensure a rewarding and fulfilling experience for you.

## Mentorship

Mentorship is at the heart of the ASoC program. Our dedicated mentors are here to guide and support you throughout your journey. They will help you navigate the project's codebase, provide valuable feedback on your contributions, and assist you in overcoming any challenges you may encounter.

Our mentors are experienced maintainers of the repspective projects who are eager to share their expertise and help you grow as an open-source contributor. They will provide clear instructions and tasks for you to work on, conduct regular check-ins and meetings, and create a collaborative and inclusive environment where you can thrive.

## Communication

Effective communication is the key to successful collaboration. We provide designated communication channels on official [ALiAS Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RRVNzDnsvZ), to facilitate seamless interaction between mentors, mentees, and other program stakeholders. We encourage you to actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and engage with your fellow participants.

Feel free to seek guidance, share your ideas, and contribute to the open source community. Our communication channels are here to foster a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone's voice is heard.

## Project Deliverables

Throughout the program, you will work on specific project deliverables. These deliverables may vary depending on the nature of the project but can include developing a working prototype, contributing to the project's codebase, creating documentation, or completing designated tasks.

Your mentor will provide guidance on the project deliverables and help you set realistic goals. Regular progress updates and contributions are essential to ensure the successful completion of your project. Remember, this is your opportunity to showcase your skills and make a meaningful impact.

## Evaluation and Recognition

At the end of the program, your hard work and dedication will be recognized. Your project and contributions will be evaluated based on various criteria, including the quality of your code, project completion, documentation, and overall contribution. We want to acknowledge your exceptional efforts and celebrate your accomplishments.

Outstanding projects or contributions may receive additional awards or special recognition as a token of appreciation. Additionally, all participants who successfully complete the program will receive certificates of completion, highlighting your dedication and achievements.

## Post-Program Engagement

The ASoC program is just the beginning of your open-source journey. We encourage you to continue contributing to the open-source community even after the program ends. Explore other projects, participate in future ASoC programs, and consider opportunities like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Outreachy, and other similar initiatives.

As an ASoC alum, you have the chance to pay it forward. Consider becoming a mentor or ambassador for future iterations of ASoC, sharing your experiences and guiding new participants. You can also document your learnings and experiences through blog posts or other forms of content creation to inspire and educate others in the open-source community.

We are here to support you throughout your ASoC journey and beyond. If you have any questions or need further clarification on the guidelines, please don't hesitate to [contact us](contact-us). Together, let's make this an incredible and transformative experience!
